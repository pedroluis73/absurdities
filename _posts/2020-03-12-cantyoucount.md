Hey future me doing past errors! Are you stupidier than ever or what? Listen here you little future shit before we go any further:
FUCK YOU if you haven't wised up by know!

Today I bring you an error that only first graders do. And that is because they have never been through this particular experience
before: counting the number of letters in the alphabet.

So this guy, who obviously does not know how many letters are there in the English alphabet decides that the best way to find it
out is to use the good old ASCII table. Good thinking Batman!! (Like my girlfriend likes to say) 

Nothing to go wrong here... if you want upper case A-Z you have 65-90 and for lower case you get 97-122.   

Simple just do:

    90 - 65 = 25
    
or if you do not like the comfort of using 5's for arithmetic operations:

    122 - 97 = 25

So there you have it: 25 letters in the Enghlish alphabet! Right? Right? WRONG!! BUT SO WRONG!!!

WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME?????

I heard this my whole live. This is nothing new to me. And still I forget it. How many numbers are there between (inclusive) 2
and 5? 
You have:

    2, 3, 4, 5
    
So 4 numbers. But clearly

    5 - 2 = 3
    
You forgot the first rule of counting, you need to add 1 to count the inclusion. And so:

    5 - 2 + 1 = 4

And applying to the alphabet:

    90 - 65 + 1 = 26
    
There ARE 26 LETTERS in the English alphabet!!

As it appears I am getting dumber and dumber with time so:

     1 - a       2 - b     3 - c
     4 - d       5 - e     6 - f
     7 - g       8 - h     9 - i
    10 - j      11 - k    12 - l
    13 - m      14 - n    15 - o
    16 - p      17 - q    18 - r
    19 - s      20 - t    21 - u
    22 - v      23 - w    24 - x
    25 - y      26 - z
